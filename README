P1: The Scanner

Option 3: FSA Table
testScanner driver is a function located within scanner.c

1st run cmd: make

All invocations should be working correctly.
From my understanding you wanted this program to be invocated with the exe object "scanner", otherwise 
it would have been exe object "main". Maybe I misunderstood.

Problems:
I do have a segfault in here, but the programs still works and tokenizes but the segfault is at the end.
I know what function is causing it but I failed at finding a fix atm, if I take the function out then most of
the tokenizing doesn't happen.

When displaying ID and Number tokens, all of them are displayed correctly. But there are dupes of partial strings throughout.




--> For STDIN:

run cmd: ./scanner

You will be prompted to type a string. When done typing pres CNTRL + D twice without pressing enter. (Yeah its dumb.)

--> For File Redirection to STDIN: 

run cmd: ./scanner < filename

--> For Reading from File:

run cmd: ./scanner filename

Any input from STDIN or files is cleansed initially to remove comments, I then put the cleansed input back into a cleansFile.fs,
which is separate from any intial file that a user could put in, fomr there the actual tokenizing will take place.
